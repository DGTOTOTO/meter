# Meter

There's a saying: "Your first 100,000 lines of code are rubbish. The key is to get through them as quickly as possible."

The same goes for photography: Your first 100,000 photos are rubbish;
for basketball, your first 100,000 shots are rubbish;
and for writing, your first 100,000 words are rubbish.


This is Meter, a tool to record your rubbish moments.
Because in life, every step counts.
